			<p>I have been a huge fan of Cardano since 2017, primarily attracted to Hoskinson and impressed by the academic development of Cardano and their commitment to releasing thoroughly tested upgrades. Initially, my friends and I wanted to develop something on Cardano just for fun, but soon enough, we found several like-minded individuals from all over Europe, and overnight, the joke turned into a serious project. Given my reputation for being full of ideas, I simply felt that Cardano was the right place for me to create alongside my friends. When it comes to blockchain, I believe we are on a ship that will revolutionize the world of monetary policy. So why not contribute to a better tomorrow if we have the
				opportunity? We just need to believe. If you believe in yourself and a better future, you are on the right ship that will eventually reach the shore.</p>

			<p>Although I had a brief introduction to the crypto world in 2015, I only really got into it in 2017 after I got excited about idea, what the decentralized financial world could mean for the world. In that time I was present at the birth of Cardano blockchain and Hoskinson's famous White board convinced me that Cardano is a real and transparent future. I started to think about how to contribute to the ecosystem and together with the other founders we got the idea about the Charly-token project. Iâ€™m the co-founder of the Charly-token project, where I use my knowledge and experience as an advisor in several areas.</p>
